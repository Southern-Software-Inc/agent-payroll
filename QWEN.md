* The folder structure in the main project folder is to remain unchanged. Do not Add folders to the main project directory, Do not remove folders from main project directory.

* The creation of Sub-folders inside any of the folders in the main project directory is permitted.

* All files that are not part of the program itself, and do not fall into any of the other catagories are to be placed in the 'temp' folder.

* All test files are to be be placed in the 'tests' folder and only in the tests folder.

* All documentation is to be placed in the 'docs' folder and absolutely no other place in the project, with the only exception being 'README.md' files which are allowed in any folder.  requirements.txt is also allowed in the main project folder.

* When creating [TODO] json files, they are to be structured exactly as specified in the 'UTWT.md'

* All [TODO] are to be placed in the 'Agent Payroll\workflow\[TODO]' folder, and absolutely no other place in the project (except the 'completed' folder once the todo has been coded into the project.)

* Prior to every single task run the ACE extension hooks to ensure the context is taylored to each task.

* Before and after each task, Ensure any memory mcp servers update their memory files and or graphs. Memory files should at all times have the up to the second information.

* All Scripts created to optimize workflow, project maintainance, etc... are to be kept in the 'scripts' folder.

* At all times the project folder and all sub folders must be maintained to the highest standards. Meaning 95% of files should be in a specific folder and not mixed in with files of all different types, etc...

* All files that are not directly part of the projects source code, documentation, [TODO], scripts, tests, or a hook should be removed from the project the moment it is no longer needed.

* MCP tools, Agent Swarms, Parallel task execution, and any other ways to expedite the production of the program, while maintaining the highest quality standards are to be used for every single task.

* If a difficult problem arises and after 3 trys the issue still remains, Use Criticalthinking, sequentialthinking, or reflection to determine theroot cause of the problem.

* The repository for this program is located at 'https://github.com/southernpitbull/agent-payroll.git' and is to be updated on the hour and on the half hour while coding.
